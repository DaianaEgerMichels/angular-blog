# Personal blog
Welcome to my repository and blog, where I share a variety of projects I have been working on. Explore the various creations, from small scripts to more robust projects.

The repository includes intuitive buttons that make it easy to access my social networks and my GitHub profile, allowing for easy and direct interaction. Additionally, some projects offer a live preview option, with links that direct you to the real-time implementation hosted on Netlify. Feel free to explore, collaborate, or reach out to share ideas and feedback. Thanks for visiting!

## Layout

The layout of this blog was inspired by a layout found on the dribbble platform.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
